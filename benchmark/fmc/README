fmc2iasp is used for computing finite models of first-order formulas. It is 
written in Python. The input formulas can be written in TPTP format. FM-Darwin
is need for clausification and flattening of the input. iClingo is used for
finding answer sets of the logic program formed by fmc2iasp. An answer set 
represents a finite model of the input.

fmc.lp is the theory-independent part of the encoding.

An example usage for computing a finite model of theory in example.tptp is like:

darwin -fd true -pfdp Exit example.tptp | fmc2iasp.py | cat fmc.lp - | iclingo

In order to compute all finite models, you can use the following command line.

darwin -fd true -pfdp Exit example.tptp | fmc2iasp.py | cat fmc.lp - | iclingo 0
