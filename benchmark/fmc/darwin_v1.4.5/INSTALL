PREREQUISITES
=============

Required:
---------

- OCaml 3.09 or higher: caml.inria.fr
Darwin is implemented in OCaml, so the OCaml native code compilers are needed.

- Unix
Darwin runs where OCaml runs, i.e. on for various Unix variants and Windows.
For Windows see the official explanation of how to compile OCampl software
at  http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html.
In short, cygwin and mingw is needed, then a self contained binary
can installed using the same procedure as in the Linux version.


Optional:
--------

- eprover 0.91 or higher: www.eprover.org
Darwin understands only clausal input,
it uses the eprover as a clausifier for non-clausal tptp input.

- python 2.3 or higher: www.python.org
the configure script (configure.py) which creates the Makefile requires python.
Alternatively, Makefile.default should be ready to use in most cases.



INSTALLATION
============
In the top directory do:

	python ./configure.py

this creates a Makefile which should work on your platform.


	make

to build the native code version of Darwin.
Darwin consists of the single file 'darwin' in the top directory.


	make htdoc

to build the source code interface documentation as html in doc/darwin/html/

Note: 'make psdoc' and 'make pdfdoc' create the documentation
as a postscript resp. pdf file in doc/darwin/latex/doc.{ps,pdf}.
'make doc' builds the documentation in all formats.

'make all' is equivalent to 'make && make doc'
